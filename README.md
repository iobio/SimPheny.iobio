## Overview

____

SimPheny.iobio is a real time **web application** for exploring phenotypic similarity between individuals from multiple populations  The application uses a combination of phenotype matching algorithms and visualization techniques to help users identify individuals with similar phenotypes. The application is designed to be used by clinicians & researchers to explore phenotypic similarity between individuals and to help interrogate undiagnosed cases of suspected genetic origin.

## Features

____

### Bring Your Own Case

Users can input a list of phenotypes for an individual and the application will return a list of individuals with similar phenotypes in a visual representation.

### Explore Available Cases

Additionally, users can explore cases from the available populations by selecting a case from the list of available cases.

### Multiple Populations

Currently the application uses publically avaible information and supports comparison of phenotypes between individuals from the following populations:

- UDN: diagnosed cases such as those available through other sources see [clinvar's submitted cases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/?LinkName=orgtrack_clinvar&from_uid=505999) for more details
- Orphanet Disease Listings

Comparrison populations can be chosen from the radio selections on the upper bar.

After comparrison populations can be filtered on or off of the chart via the chart filter options.
